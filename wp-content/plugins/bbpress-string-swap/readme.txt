In bbPress 2.1+, change Forums Archive Title (forums main page), some Breadcrumbs arguments, User Role display names plus a few other Forums Strings.

== Description ==

> #### Simply Changing Text Strings
> This **small and lightweight plugin** lets you change the Title of the Forums root view. Plus, I added 3 options for some important (as of my opinion) bbPress Breadcrumb parameters. Additionally, you can change the 4 built-in bbPress Forum User Role names. And finally, I've added 5 other important (again, as of my opinion) forum strings used in various Forum, Topic and Reply views. -- **Change all 19 strings *easily* on the bbPress main settings page**!
>
> #### Main Benefits of this Plugin
> * Fine tune your strings and display for YOUR FORUM USE CASE and used theme/templates!
> * Quick and easily adjust settings via *bbPress Main Settings* page.
> * Change strings independently from translation files.
> * Change strings as often as you want to :-)

= Important Note Regarding Themes/ Plugins =
* If your current theme or other plugins change appropiate filters this could lead to not display any or all changes made by this plugin (though it's not harmful!).
* Some themes (especially bbPress compatible ones from 'ThemeForest' marketplace) come with own templates for bbPress and also change other display things (for example breadcrumb behavior) and functions... This could also lead to not display any or all changes made by this plugin. You then have to make the wished changes manually via the theme's templates or simply just call the support of its creator for further advise.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `bbpress-string-swap` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory -- or just upload the ZIP package via 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' in your WP Admin
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

**Note for own translation/wording:** For custom and update-secure language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/bbpress-string-swap/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that, just use a language file like `bbpress-string-swap-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the tools on "Other Notes").

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I Change More Strings, for Example String 'Xyz'? =
No, not yet. The plugin just uses currently available filters in bbPress 2.2+/2.1+ plus the WordPress Gettext filter for a few other strings. So I'll only add new settings for more strings if there is an original bbPress filter/ hook available and if a setting really makes sense for some use cases (to slim down Gettext filter usage!). -- MORE and/or very special stuff could also be changed via a translation language file for bbPress and/or via WordPress' native gettext filter (see here for more info on that: [Pippin's Plugins, Introduction to the Gettext Filter](http://pippinsplugins.com/introduction-gettext-filter-wordpress/)).

= The Plugin's Settings Have No Effect in My Install!? =
*Sadly, this could be true in some cases:*

* If your current used theme or other third-party plugins change appropiate filters this could lead to not display any or all changes made by this plugin (though it's not harmful!).
* Some themes (especially bbPress compatible ones from 'ThemeForest' marketplace) come with own templates for bbPress and also change other display things (for example breadcrumb behavior) and functions... This could also lead to not display any or all changes made by this plugin. You then have to make the wished changes manually via the theme's templates or simply just call the support of its creator for further advise.

*Note:* All my plugins are internationalized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating I recommend the awesome ["Codestyling Localization" plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codestyling-localization/) and for validating the ["Poedit Editor"](http://www.poedit.net/), which works fine on Windows, Mac and Linux.

== Additional Info ==
**Idea Behind / Philosophy:** I've come across some user requests to change the title of the forums archive (a.k.a. root view). When researching for the proper filter for changing this I thought it would be handy to also change a few important breadcrumb parameters along with the title :). So this plugin was born. Nothing spectacular, though. Maybe a few other strings will be added in the future (only if it makes sense!).
